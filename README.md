The Generative Landscape
================

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This is still a work in progress, but most of the important bits should
be done in time for a launch on Friday, Novermer 25! In the meantime,
you can check out my [previous course,
AIAIART](https://github.com/johnowhitaker/aiaiart) or join the Discord
where I’ll be streaming final lesson checks and updates. <br>

If you want to support this effort, I now have a Patreon:
<https://www.patreon.com/johnowhitaker> <br>

The material will show in github pages at
<https://johnowhitaker.github.io/tglcourse/> (and the
http://thegenerativelandscape.com will redirect there now too). Hooray
for the magic of nbdev. <br>

Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/vSjhr8xb4g) to discuss the course,
join study groups or chat about all things generative. That’s also the
place to go for notifications of live lesson walkthroughs and course
updates.

Check out the [Getting Started](./00_Getting_Started.ipynb) page for an
overview of the course and more information on things like study groups.

### The Plan

The idea is to have a core curriculum building up to an understanding of
key generative modelling techniques, split into three rough sections.
The first 5 lessons will cover basics of building NNs and crafting loss
functions. Lessons 6-10 will introduce generative modelling, GANs and
working with sequences using transformers. Lessons 11-15 will be a deep
dive into diffusion models, and lesson 16 will wrap up and give
sugestions for new directions to explore.

Alongside this will be a number of ‘bonus’ notebooks that don’t need to
be completed but which augment the core content. Managing datasets,
experiment tracking, sharing demos and so on. Some will augment specific
lessons, some will add functionality to the library and some will just
be standalone topics I think are cool. The latter category is likely to
continue to grow even after the course launches :)

There will be three suggested projects (after lessons 5, 11 and 14) to
mark milestones in the course, and the final lesson will also encourage
you to do a larger project at the end. Once we launch there’ll be a
place to everyone’s projects and some prizes for the best.

This table has a rough status on the main lessons.
