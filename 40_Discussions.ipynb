    "Most of this course is me (Jonathan Whitaker) talking into my webcam. I do my best to cover the different topics we explore in this course, but you're ultimately getting a single viewpoint on all of this - not ideal! There are thousands of people with unique backgrounds and perspectives working in this space, and this discussions series is an attempt to bring in some of those different voices and ideas. If there is someone you think should be on this list, please reach out and let me know! I'm still figuring out the recording workflow, so some early interviews might have slightly sub-optimal audio - I'll add transcripts ASAP. "

    "\n",
    "Apolinário is one of the best folks to follow to keep track of what is happening in this space. His 'MindsEye' tool and more recently the 'Majesty Diffusion' notebook have helped to make some of the latest AI art techniques easier to use for non-technical users. These days he works at HuggingFace in the intersection between the technical side and the artistic community. In this conversation we discuss his journey and work, how to stay on top of new releases and how to get involved."
